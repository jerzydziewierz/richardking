          <p>Laura says:</p>
          <p>One day I went with Richard to the st. Michael Hospital ..he had his first radiotherapy and was scared. No family member was allowed because of lockdown..but I was working as an interpreter and could go. While we were waiting for the treatment I tried to keep Richard's mind busy so I opened my phone and started to show him the pictures of his lovely hiking.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Richard never talked about his end and the after‚Ä¶ but we were that day in a hospital and he told me: when I am no more here I hope people remind me with a smile on their face. I do not want people crying for me. So I asked him: let s find the best pic to use for this ... he looked at many pictures and did not know which one was the best..he did not want to choose pic with him and other people..because he thought the people who were not in that pic could be offended..he was always considerate about everyone, included those people who hurt him... so at the end laughing said: this is the pic. Everyone knows my story of the chocolate found in the pub üíõüåª</p>
